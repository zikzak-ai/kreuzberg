#### ExtractionResult

General extraction result used by the core extraction API.

This is the main result type returned by all extraction functions.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `content` | `String` | — | The extracted text content |
| `mime_type` | `String` | — | The detected MIME type |
| `metadata` | `Metadata` | — | Document metadata |
| `tables` | `Vec<String>` | `vec![]` | Tables extracted from the document |
| `detected_languages` | `Vec<String>` | `vec![]` | Detected languages |
| `chunks` | `Vec<Chunk>` | `vec![]` | Text chunks when chunking is enabled. When chunking configuration is provided, the content is split into overlapping chunks for efficient processing. Each chunk contains the text, optional embeddings (if enabled), and metadata about its position. |
| `images` | `Vec<ExtractedImage>` | `vec![]` | Extracted images from the document. When image extraction is enabled via `ImageExtractionConfig`, this field contains all images found in the document with their raw data and metadata. Each image may optionally contain a nested `ocr_result` if OCR was performed. |
| `pages` | `Vec<PageContent>` | `vec![]` | Per-page content when page extraction is enabled. When page extraction is configured, the document is split into per-page content with tables and images mapped to their respective pages. |
| `elements` | `Vec<Element>` | `vec![]` | Semantic elements when element-based result format is enabled. When result_format is set to ElementBased, this field contains semantic elements with type classification, unique identifiers, and metadata for Unstructured-compatible element-based processing. |
| `djot_content` | `Option<DjotContent>` | `Default::default()` | Rich Djot content structure (when extracting Djot documents). When extracting Djot documents with structured extraction enabled, this field contains the full semantic structure including: - Block-level elements with nesting - Inline formatting with attributes - Links, images, footnotes - Math expressions - Complete attribute information The `content` field still contains plain text for backward compatibility. Always `None` for non-Djot documents. |
| `ocr_elements` | `Vec<OcrElement>` | `vec![]` | OCR elements with full spatial and confidence metadata. When OCR is performed with element extraction enabled, this field contains the structured representation of detected text including: - Bounding geometry (rectangles or quadrilaterals) - Confidence scores (detection and recognition) - Rotation information - Hierarchical relationships (Tesseract only) This field preserves all metadata that would otherwise be lost when converting to plain text or markdown output formats. Only populated when `OcrElementConfig.include_elements` is true. |
| `document` | `Option<DocumentStructure>` | `Default::default()` | Structured document tree (when document structure extraction is enabled). When `include_document_structure` is true in `ExtractionConfig`, this field contains the full hierarchical representation of the document including: - Heading-driven section nesting - Table grids with cell-level metadata - Content layer classification (body, header, footer, footnote) - Inline text annotations (formatting, links) - Bounding boxes and page numbers Independent of `result_format` — can be combined with Unified or ElementBased. |
| `quality_score` | `Option<f64>` | `Default::default()` | Document quality score from quality analysis. A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the overall text quality. Previously stored in `metadata.additional["quality_score"]`. |
| `processing_warnings` | `Vec<ProcessingWarning>` | `vec![]` | Non-fatal warnings collected during processing pipeline stages. Captures errors from optional pipeline features (embedding, chunking, language detection, output formatting) that don't prevent extraction but may indicate degraded results. Previously stored as individual keys in `metadata.additional`. |
| `annotations` | `Vec<PdfAnnotation>` | `vec![]` | PDF annotations extracted from the document. When annotation extraction is enabled via `PdfConfig.extract_annotations`, this field contains text notes, highlights, links, stamps, and other annotations found in PDF documents. |
| `children` | `Vec<ArchiveEntry>` | `vec![]` | Nested extraction results from archive contents. When extracting archives, each processable file inside produces its own full extraction result. Set to `None` for non-archive formats. Use `max_archive_depth` in config to control recursion depth. |
| `uris` | `Vec<Uri>` | `vec![]` | URIs/links discovered during document extraction. Contains hyperlinks, image references, citations, email addresses, and other URI-like references found in the document. Always extracted when present in the source document. |
| `structured_output` | `Option<serde_json::Value>` | `Default::default()` | Structured extraction output from LLM-based JSON schema extraction. When `structured_extraction` is configured in `ExtractionConfig`, the extracted document content is sent to a VLM with the provided JSON schema. The response is parsed and stored here as a JSON value matching the schema. |
| `code_intelligence` | `Option<String>` | `Default::default()` | Code intelligence results from tree-sitter analysis. Populated when extracting source code files with the `tree-sitter` feature. Contains metrics, structural analysis, imports/exports, comments, docstrings, symbols, diagnostics, and optionally chunked code segments. |
| `llm_usage` | `Vec<LlmUsage>` | `vec![]` | LLM token usage and cost data for all LLM calls made during this extraction. Contains one entry per LLM call. Multiple entries are produced when VLM OCR, structured extraction, and/or LLM embeddings all run during the same extraction. `None` when no LLM was used. |
| `formatted_content` | `Option<String>` | `Default::default()` | Pre-rendered content in the requested output format. Populated during `derive_extraction_result` before tree derivation consumes element data. `apply_output_format` swaps this into `content` at the end of the pipeline, after post-processors have operated on plain text. |
| `ocr_internal_document` | `Option<String>` | `Default::default()` | Structured hOCR document for the OCR+layout pipeline. When tesseract produces hOCR output, the parsed `InternalDocument` carries paragraph structure with bounding boxes and confidence scores. The layout classification step enriches these elements before final rendering. |

for inference in layout detection and embedding generation.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | `ExecutionProviderType` | `ExecutionProviderType::Auto` | Execution provider to use for ONNX inference. |
| `device_id` | `u32` | — | GPU device ID (for CUDA/TensorRT). Ignored for CPU/CoreML/Auto. |

---

#### ContentFilterConfig

Cross-extractor content filtering configuration.

Controls whether "furniture" content (headers, footers, page numbers,
watermarks, repeating text) is included in or stripped from extraction
results. Applies across all extractors (PDF, DOCX, RTF, ODT, HTML, etc.)
with format-specific implementation.

When `None` on `ExtractionConfig`, each extractor uses its current
default behavior unchanged.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `include_headers` | `bool` | `false` | Include running headers in extraction output. - PDF: Disables top-margin furniture stripping and prevents the layout model from treating `PageHeader`-classified regions as furniture. - DOCX: Includes document headers in text output. - RTF/ODT: Headers already included; this is a no-op when true. - HTML/EPUB: Keeps `<header>` element content. Default: `false` (headers are stripped or excluded). |
| `include_footers` | `bool` | `false` | Include running footers in extraction output. - PDF: Disables bottom-margin furniture stripping and prevents the layout model from treating `PageFooter`-classified regions as furniture. - DOCX: Includes document footers in text output. - RTF/ODT: Footers already included; this is a no-op when true. - HTML/EPUB: Keeps `<footer>` element content. Default: `false` (footers are stripped or excluded). |
| `strip_repeating_text` | `bool` | `true` | Enable the heuristic cross-page repeating text detector. When `true` (default), text that repeats verbatim across a supermajority of pages is classified as furniture and stripped.  Disable this if brand names or repeated headings are being incorrectly removed by the heuristic. Note: when a layout-detection model is active, the model may independently classify page-header / page-footer regions as furniture on a per-page basis. To preserve those regions, set `include_headers = true` and/or `include_footers = true` in addition to disabling this flag. Primarily affects PDF extraction. Default: `true`. |
| `include_watermarks` | `bool` | `false` | Include watermark text in extraction output. - PDF: Keeps watermark artifacts and arXiv identifiers. - Other formats: No effect currently. Default: `false` (watermarks are stripped). |

---

#### EmailConfig

Configuration for email extraction.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `msg_fallback_codepage` | `Option<u32>` | `Default::default()` | Windows codepage number to use when an MSG file contains no codepage property. Defaults to `None`, which falls back to windows-1252. If an unrecognized or invalid codepage number is supplied (including 0), the behavior silently falls back to windows-1252 — the same as when the MSG file itself contains an unrecognized codepage. No error or warning is emitted. Users should verify output when supplying unusual values. Common values: - 1250: Central European (Polish, Czech, Hungarian, etc.) - 1251: Cyrillic (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, etc.) - 1252: Western European (default) - 1253: Greek - 1254: Turkish - 1255: Hebrew - 1256: Arabic - 932:  Japanese (Shift-JIS) - 936:  Simplified Chinese (GBK) |

---

#### ExtractionConfig

Main extraction configuration.

This struct contains all configuration options for the extraction process.
It can be loaded from TOML, YAML, or JSON files, or created programmatically.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `use_cache` | `bool` | `true` | Enable caching of extraction results |
| `enable_quality_processing` | `bool` | `true` | Enable quality post-processing |
| `ocr` | `Option<OcrConfig>` | `None` | OCR configuration (None = OCR disabled) |
| `force_ocr` | `bool` | `false` | Force OCR even for searchable PDFs |
| `force_ocr_pages` | `Vec<usize>` | `None` | Force OCR on specific pages only (1-indexed page numbers, must be >= 1). When set, only the listed pages are OCR'd regardless of text layer quality. Unlisted pages use native text extraction. Ignored when `force_ocr` is `true`. Only applies to PDF documents. Duplicates are automatically deduplicated. An `ocr` config is recommended for backend/language selection; defaults are used if absent. |
| `disable_ocr` | `bool` | `false` | Disable OCR entirely, even for images. When `true`, OCR is skipped for all document types. Images return metadata only (dimensions, format, EXIF) without text extraction. PDFs use only native text extraction without OCR fallback. Cannot be `true` simultaneously with `force_ocr`. *Added in v4.7.0.* |
| `chunking` | `Option<ChunkingConfig>` | `None` | Text chunking configuration (None = chunking disabled) |
| `content_filter` | `Option<ContentFilterConfig>` | `None` | Content filtering configuration (None = use extractor defaults). Controls whether document "furniture" (headers, footers, watermarks, repeating text) is included in or stripped from extraction results. See `ContentFilterConfig` for per-field documentation. |
| `images` | `Option<ImageExtractionConfig>` | `None` | Image extraction configuration (None = no image extraction) |
| `pdf_options` | `Option<PdfConfig>` | `None` | PDF-specific options (None = use defaults) |
| `token_reduction` | `Option<TokenReductionOptions>` | `None` | Token reduction configuration (None = no token reduction) |
| `language_detection` | `Option<LanguageDetectionConfig>` | `None` | Language detection configuration (None = no language detection) |
| `pages` | `Option<PageConfig>` | `None` | Page extraction configuration (None = no page tracking) |
| `postprocessor` | `Option<PostProcessorConfig>` | `None` | Post-processor configuration (None = use defaults) |
| `html_options` | `Option<String>` | `None` | HTML to Markdown conversion options (None = use defaults) Configure how HTML documents are converted to Markdown, including heading styles, list formatting, code block styles, and preprocessing options. |
| `html_output` | `Option<HtmlOutputConfig>` | `None` | Styled HTML output configuration. When set alongside `output_format = OutputFormat.Html`, the extraction pipeline uses `StyledHtmlRenderer` which emits stable `kb-*` CSS class hooks on every structural element and optionally embeds theme CSS or user-supplied CSS in a `<style>` block. When `None`, the existing plain comrak-based HTML renderer is used. |
| `extraction_timeout_secs` | `Option<u64>` | `None` | Default per-file timeout in seconds for batch extraction. When set, each file in a batch will be canceled after this duration unless overridden by `FileExtractionConfig.timeout_secs`. `None` means no timeout (unbounded extraction time). |
| `max_concurrent_extractions` | `Option<usize>` | `None` | Maximum concurrent extractions in batch operations (None = (num_cpus × 1.5).ceil()). Limits parallelism to prevent resource exhaustion when processing large batches. Defaults to (num_cpus × 1.5).ceil() when not set. |
| `result_format` | `String` | — | Result structure format Controls whether results are returned in unified format (default) with all content in the `content` field, or element-based format with semantic elements (for Unstructured-compatible output). |
| `security_limits` | `Option<String>` | `None` | Security limits for archive extraction. Controls maximum archive size, compression ratio, file count, and other security thresholds to prevent decompression bomb attacks. When `None`, default limits are used (500MB archive, 100:1 ratio, 10K files). |
| `output_format` | `String` | `Plain` | Content text format (default: Plain). Controls the format of the extracted content: - `Plain`: Raw extracted text (default) - `Markdown`: Markdown formatted output - `Djot`: Djot markup format (requires djot feature) - `Html`: HTML formatted output When set to a structured format, extraction results will include formatted output. The `formatted_content` field may be populated when format conversion is applied. |
| `layout` | `Option<LayoutDetectionConfig>` | `None` | Layout detection configuration (None = layout detection disabled). When set, PDF pages and images are analyzed for document structure (headings, code, formulas, tables, figures, etc.) using RT-DETR models via ONNX Runtime. For PDFs, layout hints override paragraph classification in the markdown pipeline. For images, per-region OCR is performed with markdown formatting based on detected layout classes. Requires the `layout-detection` feature. |
| `include_document_structure` | `bool` | `false` | Enable structured document tree output. When true, populates the `document` field on `ExtractionResult` with a hierarchical `DocumentStructure` containing heading-driven section nesting, table grids, content layer classification, and inline annotations. Independent of `result_format` — can be combined with Unified or ElementBased. |
| `acceleration` | `Option<AccelerationConfig>` | `None` | Hardware acceleration configuration for ONNX Runtime models. Controls execution provider selection for layout detection and embedding models. When `None`, uses platform defaults (CoreML on macOS, CUDA on Linux, CPU on Windows). |
| `cache_namespace` | `Option<String>` | `None` | Cache namespace for tenant isolation. When set, cache entries are stored under `{cache_dir}/{namespace}/`. Must be alphanumeric, hyphens, or underscores only (max 64 chars). Different namespaces have isolated cache spaces on the same filesystem. |
| `cache_ttl_secs` | `Option<u64>` | `None` | Per-request cache TTL in seconds. Overrides the global `max_age_days` for this specific extraction. When `0`, caching is completely skipped (no read or write). When `None`, the global TTL applies. |
| `email` | `Option<EmailConfig>` | `None` | Email extraction configuration (None = use defaults). Currently supports configuring the fallback codepage for MSG files that do not specify one. See `crate.core.config.EmailConfig` for details. |
| `concurrency` | `Option<String>` | `None` | Concurrency limits for constrained environments (None = use defaults). Controls Rayon thread pool size, ONNX Runtime intra-op threads, and (when `max_concurrent_extractions` is unset) the batch concurrency semaphore. See `crate.core.config.ConcurrencyConfig` for details. |
| `max_archive_depth` | `usize` | — | Maximum recursion depth for archive extraction (default: 3). Set to 0 to disable recursive extraction (legacy behavior). |
| `tree_sitter` | `Option<TreeSitterConfig>` | `None` | Tree-sitter language pack configuration (None = tree-sitter disabled). When set, enables code file extraction using tree-sitter parsers. Controls grammar download behavior and code analysis options. |
| `structured_extraction` | `Option<StructuredExtractionConfig>` | `None` | Structured extraction via LLM (None = disabled). When set, the extracted document content is sent to an LLM with the provided JSON schema. The structured response is stored in `ExtractionResult.structured_output`. |
| `cancel_token` | `Option<String>` | `None` | Cancellation token for this extraction (None = no external cancellation). Pass a `CancellationToken` clone here and call `CancellationToken.cancel` from another thread / task to abort the extraction in progress. The extractor checks the token at safe checkpoints (before lock acquisition, between pages, between batch items) and returns `KreuzbergError.Cancelled` when set. The field is excluded from serialization because `CancellationToken` is a runtime handle, not a configuration value. |

#### OcrQualityThresholds

Quality thresholds for OCR fallback decisions and pipeline quality gating.

All fields default to the values that match the previous hardcoded behavior,

| `auto_rotate` | `bool` | `false` | Enable automatic page rotation based on orientation detection. When enabled, uses Tesseract's `DetectOrientationScript()` to detect page orientation (0/90/180/270 degrees) before OCR. If the page is rotated with high confidence, the image is corrected before recognition. This is critical for handling rotated scanned documents. |
| `vlm_config` | `Option<LlmConfig>` | `None` | VLM (Vision Language Model) OCR configuration. Required when `backend` is `"vlm"`. Uses liter-llm to send page images to a vision model for text extraction. |

#### PageContent

Content for a single page/slide.

When page extraction is enabled, documents are split into per-page content
with associated tables and images mapped to each page.

# Performance

Uses Arc-wrapped tables and images for memory efficiency:
- `Vec<Arc<Table>>` enables zero-copy sharing of table data
- `Vec<Arc<ExtractedImage>>` enables zero-copy sharing of image data
- Maintains exact JSON compatibility via custom Serialize/Deserialize

This reduces memory overhead for documents with shared tables/images
by avoiding redundant copies during serialization.
