| `formatted_content`     | `Option<String>`            | `Default::default()` | Pre-rendered content in the requested output format. Populated during `derive_extraction_result` before tree derivation consumes element data. `apply_output_format` swaps this into `content` at the end of the pipeline, after post-processors have operated on plain text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `ocr_internal_document` | `Option<String>`            | `Default::default()` | Structured hOCR document for the OCR+layout pipeline. When tesseract produces hOCR output, the parsed `InternalDocument` carries paragraph structure with bounding boxes and confidence scores. The layout classification step enriches these elements before final rendering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### ContentFilterConfig

Cross-extractor content filtering configuration.

Controls whether "furniture" content (headers, footers, page numbers,
watermarks, repeating text) is included in or stripped from extraction
results. Applies across all extractors (PDF, DOCX, RTF, ODT, HTML, etc.)
with format-specific implementation.

When `None` on `ExtractionConfig`, each extractor uses its current
default behavior unchanged.

| Field                  | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `include_headers`      | `bool` | `false` | Include running headers in extraction output. - PDF: Disables top-margin furniture stripping and prevents the layout model from treating `PageHeader`-classified regions as furniture. - DOCX: Includes document headers in text output. - RTF/ODT: Headers already included; this is a no-op when true. - HTML/EPUB: Keeps `<header>` element content. Default: `false` (headers are stripped or excluded).                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `include_footers`      | `bool` | `false` | Include running footers in extraction output. - PDF: Disables bottom-margin furniture stripping and prevents the layout model from treating `PageFooter`-classified regions as furniture. - DOCX: Includes document footers in text output. - RTF/ODT: Footers already included; this is a no-op when true. - HTML/EPUB: Keeps `<footer>` element content. Default: `false` (footers are stripped or excluded).                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `strip_repeating_text` | `bool` | `true`  | Enable the heuristic cross-page repeating text detector. When `true` (default), text that repeats verbatim across a supermajority of pages is classified as furniture and stripped. Disable this if brand names or repeated headings are being incorrectly removed by the heuristic. Note: when a layout-detection model is active, the model may independently classify page-header / page-footer regions as furniture on a per-page basis. To preserve those regions, set `include_headers = true` and/or `include_footers = true` in addition to disabling this flag. Primarily affects PDF extraction. Default: `true`. |
| `include_watermarks`   | `bool` | `false` | Include watermark text in extraction output. - PDF: Keeps watermark artifacts and arXiv identifiers. - Other formats: No effect currently. Default: `false` (watermarks are stripped).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `msg_fallback_codepage` | `Option<u32>` | `Default::default()` | Windows codepage number to use when an MSG file contains no codepage property. Defaults to `None`, which falls back to windows-1252. If an unrecognized or invalid codepage number is supplied (including 0), the behavior silently falls back to windows-1252 — the same as when the MSG file itself contains an unrecognized codepage. No error or warning is emitted. Users should verify output when supplying unusual values. Common values: - 1250: Central European (Polish, Czech, Hungarian, etc.) - 1251: Cyrillic (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, etc.) - 1252: Western European (default) - 1253: Greek - 1254: Turkish - 1255: Hebrew - 1256: Arabic - 932: Japanese (Shift-JIS) - 936: Simplified Chinese (GBK) |

When set, each file in a batch will be canceled after this duration unless overridden by `FileExtractionConfig.timeout_secs`. `None` means no timeout (unbounded extraction time).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `max_concurrent_extractions` | `Option<usize>`                      | `None`                  | Maximum concurrent extractions in batch operations (None = (num_cpus × 1.5).ceil()). Limits parallelism to prevent resource exhaustion when processing large batches. Defaults to (num_cpus × 1.5).ceil() when not set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `result_format`              | `ResultFormat`                       | `ResultFormat::Unified` | Result structure format Controls whether results are returned in unified format (default) with all content in the `content` field, or element-based format with semantic elements (for Unstructured-compatible output).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `security_limits`            | `Option<SecurityLimits>`             | `None`                  | Security limits for archive extraction. Controls maximum archive size, compression ratio, file count, and other security thresholds to prevent decompression bomb attacks. Also caps nesting depth, iteration count, entity / token length, cumulative content size, and table cell count for every extraction path that ingests user-controlled bytes. When `None`, default limits are used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `output_format`              | `OutputFormat`                       | `OutputFormat::Plain`   | Content text format (default: Plain). Controls the format of the extracted content: - `Plain`: Raw extracted text (default) - `Markdown`: Markdown formatted output - `Djot`: Djot markup format (requires djot feature) - `Html`: HTML formatted output When set to a structured format, extraction results will include formatted output. The `formatted_content` field may be populated when format conversion is applied.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `layout`                     | `Option<LayoutDetectionConfig>`      | `None`                  | Layout detection configuration (None = layout detection disabled). When set, PDF pages and images are analyzed for document structure (headings, code, formulas, tables, figures, etc.) using RT-DETR models via ONNX Runtime. For PDFs, layout hints override paragraph classification in the markdown pipeline. For images, per-region OCR is performed with markdown formatting based on detected layout classes. Requires the `layout-detection` feature to run inference; the field is present whenever the `layout-types` feature is active (which includes `layout-detection` as well as the no-ORT target groups). |
| `use_layout_for_markdown`    | `bool`                               | `false`                 | Run layout detection on the non-OCR PDF markdown path. When `true` and `layout` is `Some(_)`, layout regions inform heading, table, list, and figure detection in the structure pipeline that would otherwise rely on font-clustering heuristics alone. Substantially improves SF1 (structural F1) at the cost of inference latency (~150-300ms/page CPU, ~20-50ms/page GPU). Default: `false`. Requires the `layout-detection` feature.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `include_document_structure` | `bool`                               | `false`                 | Enable structured document tree output. When true, populates the `document` field on `ExtractionResult` with a hierarchical `DocumentStructure` containing heading-driven section nesting, table grids, content layer classification, and inline annotations. Independent of `result_format` — can be combined with Unified or ElementBased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `acceleration`               | `Option<AccelerationConfig>`         | `None`                  | Hardware acceleration configuration for ONNX Runtime models. Controls execution provider selection for layout detection and embedding models. When `None`, uses platform defaults (CoreML on macOS, CUDA on Linux, CPU on Windows).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

When set, cache entries are stored under `{cache_dir}/{namespace}/`. Must be alphanumeric, hyphens, or underscores only (max 64 chars). Different namespaces have isolated cache spaces on the same filesystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Controls Rayon thread pool size, ONNX Runtime intra-op threads, and (when `max_concurrent_extractions` is unset) the batch concurrency semaphore. See `ConcurrencyConfig` for details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `max_archive_depth`          | `usize`                              | —                       | Maximum recursion depth for archive extraction (default: 3).

| `structured_extraction`      | `Option<StructuredExtractionConfig>` | `None`                  | Structured extraction via LLM (None = disabled). When set, the extracted document content is sent to an LLM with the provided JSON schema. The structured response is stored in `ExtractionResult.structured_output`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Pass a `CancellationToken` clone here and call `CancellationToken.cancel` from another thread / task to abort the extraction in progress. The extractor checks the token at safe checkpoints (before lock acquisition, between pages, between batch items) and returns `KreuzbergError.Cancelled` when set. The field is excluded from serialization because `CancellationToken` is a runtime handle, not a configuration value.                                                                                                                 |

#### FileExtractionConfig

Per-file extraction configuration overrides for batch processing.

All fields are `Option<T>` — `None` means "use the batch-level default."
This type is used with `batch_extract_files` and
`batch_extract_bytes` to allow heterogeneous
extraction settings within a single batch.

## Excluded Fields

The following `ExtractionConfig` fields are batch-level only and
cannot be overridden per file:

- `max_concurrent_extractions` — controls batch parallelism
- `use_cache` — global caching policy

| `max_images_per_page` | `Option<u32>` | `None`  | Maximum number of image objects to extract per PDF page. Some PDFs (e.g. technical diagrams stored as thousands of raster fragments) can trigger extremely long or indefinite extraction times when every image object on a dense page is decoded individually via the PDF extractor. Setting this limit causes kreuzberg to stop collecting individual images once the count per page reaches the cap and emit a warning instead. `None` (default) means no limit — all images are extracted. |
| `classify`            | `bool`        | `true`  | When `true` (default), extracted images are classified by kind and grouped into clusters where they appear to belong to one figure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `class_prefix` | `String`          | —                     | CSS class prefix applied to every emitted class name. Default: `"kb-"`. Change this if your host application already uses classes that start with `kb-`.                                                                                            |
| `embed_css`    | `bool`            | `true`                | When `true` (default), write the resolved CSS into a `<style>` block immediately after the opening `<div class="{prefix}doc">`.

##### OcrQualityThresholds

Quality thresholds for OCR fallback decisions and pipeline quality gating.

All fields default to the values that match the previous hardcoded behavior,
so `OcrQualityThresholds.default()` preserves existing semantics exactly.

##### OcrPipelineConfig

Multi-backend OCR pipeline with quality-based fallback.

Backends are tried in priority order (highest first). After each backend
produces output, quality is evaluated. If it meets `quality_thresholds.pipeline_min_quality`,
the result is accepted. Otherwise the next backend is tried.

| Field                | Type                    | Default | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stages`             | `Vec<OcrPipelineStage>` | —       | Ordered list of backends to try. Sorted by priority (descending) at runtime.        |
| `quality_thresholds` | `OcrQualityThresholds`  | —       | Quality thresholds for deciding whether to accept a result or try the next backend. |

| `enabled`            | `bool`                         | `true`  | Whether OCR is enabled. Setting `enabled: false` is a shorthand for `disable_ocr: true` on the parent `ExtractionConfig`. Images return metadata only; PDFs use native text extraction without OCR fallback. Defaults to `true`. When `false`, all other OCR settings are ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `backend_options`    | `Option<serde_json::Value>`    | `None`  | Arbitrary per-call options passed through to the backend unchanged. Custom OCR backends and built-in backends that support runtime tuning can read this value and deserialize the keys they care about. Keys unknown to the backend are silently ignored. This is the recommended extension point for per-call parameters that are not covered by the typed fields above (e.g. mode switching, preprocessing flags, inference batch size). **Scope:** when `pipeline` is `None`, this value is propagated to the primary stage of the auto-constructed pipeline. When `pipeline` is explicitly set, this field has **no effect** — the caller must set `OcrPipelineStage.backend_options` directly on the relevant stage(s) instead. Example: `json { "mode": "fast", "enable_layout": true, "timeout_ms": 5000 }` |
| `element_config`     | `Option<OcrElementConfig>`     | `None`  | OCR element extraction configuration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `quality_thresholds` | `Option<OcrQualityThresholds>` | `None`  | Quality thresholds for the native-text-to-OCR fallback decision. When None, uses compiled defaults (matching previous hardcoded behavior).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `pipeline`           | `Option<OcrPipelineConfig>`    | `None`  | Multi-backend OCR pipeline configuration. When set, enables weighted fallback across multiple OCR backends based on output quality. When None, uses the single `backend` field (same as today).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `auto_rotate`        | `bool`                         | `false` | Enable automatic page rotation based on orientation detection. When enabled, uses Tesseract's `DetectOrientationScript()` to detect page orientation (0/90/180/270 degrees) before OCR. If the page is rotated with high confidence, the image is corrected before recognition. This is critical for handling rotated scanned documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `vlm_config`         | `Option<LlmConfig>`            | `None`  | VLM (Vision Language Model) OCR configuration. Required when `backend` is `"vlm"`. Uses liter-llm to send page images to a vision model for text extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `vlm_prompt`         | `Option<String>`               | `None`  | Custom Jinja2 prompt template for VLM OCR. When `None`, uses the default template. Available variables: - `{{ language }}` — The document language code (e.g., "eng", "deu").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `acceleration`       | `Option<AccelerationConfig>`   | `None`  | Hardware acceleration for ONNX Runtime models (e.g. PaddleOCR, layout detection). Not user-configurable via config files — injected at runtime from `ExtractionConfig.acceleration` before each `process_image` call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `tessdata_bytes`     | `HashMap<String, Vec<u8>>`     | `None`  | Caller-supplied Tesseract `traineddata` bytes per language code. Primary use case is the WASM build, which has no filesystem and cannot download tessdata at runtime. Native builds typically rely on `TessdataManager` and ignore this field. When present, the WASM Tesseract backend prefers these bytes over its compile-time-bundled English data. Skipped by serde to keep config files small — supply via the typed API at runtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

##### PageConfig

Page extraction and tracking configuration.

Controls how pages are extracted, tracked, and represented in the extraction results.
When `None`, page tracking is disabled.

Page range tracking in chunk metadata (first_page/last_page) is automatically enabled
when page boundaries are available and chunking is configured.

| --------------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `extract_pages`       | `bool`   | `false` | Extract pages as separate array (ExtractionResult.pages) |
| `insert_page_markers` | `bool`   | `false` | Insert page markers in main content string               |
| `marker_format` | `String` | `" |  |

<!-- PAGE {page_num} -->

"` | Page marker format (use {page_num} placeholder) Default: "\n\n<!-- PAGE {page_num} -->\n\n" |

| `extract_images`             | `bool`                    | `false` | Extract images from PDF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `extract_tables`             | `bool`                    | `true`  | Extract tables from PDF. When `true` (default), runs pdf_oxide's native grid detector and, if it finds nothing, falls back to the heuristic text-layer reconstruction in `pdf.oxide.table.extract_tables_heuristic`. Set to `false` to skip both passes — `tables` will then be empty in the result.                                                                                                  |

| `extract_metadata`           | `bool`                    | `true`  | Extract PDF metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `hierarchy`                  | `Option<HierarchyConfig>` | `None`  | Hierarchy extraction configuration (None = hierarchy extraction disabled)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `extract_annotations`        | `bool`                    | `false` | Extract PDF annotations (text notes, highlights, links, stamps). Default: false                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `top_margin_fraction`        | `Option<f32>`             | `None`  | Top margin fraction (0.0–1.0) of page height to exclude headers/running heads. Default: 0.06 (6%)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `bottom_margin_fraction`     | `Option<f32>`             | `None`  | Bottom margin fraction (0.0–1.0) of page height to exclude footers/page numbers. Default: 0.05 (5%)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `allow_single_column_tables` | `bool`                    | `false` | Allow single-column pseudo tables in extraction results. By default, tables with fewer than 2 columns (layout-guided) or 3 columns (heuristic) are rejected. When `true`, the minimum column count is relaxed to 1, allowing single-column structured data (glossaries, itemized lists) to be emitted as tables. Other quality filters (density, sparsity, prose detection) still apply.              |
| `ocr_inline_images`          | `bool`                    | `false` | Perform OCR on inline images extracted from PDF pages and attach the recognized text to each `ExtractedImage.ocr_result`. Requires Tesseract to be available; if `ExtractionConfig.ocr` is `None` the extractor falls back to `TesseractConfig.default()`. Per-image failures degrade gracefully (the image is returned without OCR text rather than failing the whole extraction). Default: `false`. |

##### HierarchyConfig

Hierarchy extraction configuration for PDF text structure analysis.

Enables extraction of document hierarchy levels (H1-H6) based on font size
clustering and semantic analysis. When enabled, hierarchical blocks are
included in page content.

| Field                    | Type          | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `k_clusters`             | `usize`       | `3`     | Number of font size clusters to use for hierarchy levels (1-7) Default: 6, which provides H1-H6 heading levels with body text. Larger values create more fine-grained hierarchy levels.                                                                                   |
| `include_bbox`           | `bool`        | `true`  | Include bounding box information in hierarchy blocks                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `ocr_coverage_threshold` | `Option<f32>` | `None`  | OCR coverage threshold for smart OCR triggering (0.0-1.0) Determines when OCR should be triggered based on text block coverage. OCR is triggered when text blocks cover less than this fraction of the page. Default: 0.5 (trigger OCR if less than 50% of page has text) |

##### PostProcessorConfig

Post-processor configuration.

| Field                 | Type             | Default | Description                                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`             | `bool`           | `true`  | Enable post-processors                                      |
| `enabled_processors`  | `Vec<String>`    | `None`  | Whitelist of processor names to run (None = all enabled)    |
| `disabled_processors` | `Vec<String>`    | `None`  | Blacklist of processor names to skip (None = none disabled) |

Enable `chunking-tiktoken` or `chunking-tokenizers` features for token-based sizing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `prepend_heading_context` | `bool`                    | `false`                   | When `true` and `chunker_type` is `Markdown`, prepend the heading hierarchy path (e.g. `"# Title > ## Section\n\n"`) to each chunk's content string. This is useful for RAG pipelines where each chunk needs self-contained context about its position in the document structure. Default: `false`                                                                                       |
| `topic_threshold`         | `Option<f32>`             | `None`                    | Optional cosine similarity threshold for semantic topic boundary detection. Only used when `chunker_type` is `Semantic` and an `EmbeddingConfig` is provided. You almost never need to set this. When omitted, defaults to `0.75` which works well for most documents. Lower values detect more topic boundaries (more, smaller chunks); higher values detect fewer. Range: `0.0..=1.0`. |

| `max_embed_duration_secs` | `Option<u64>`                | `Default::default()`         | Maximum wall-clock duration (in seconds) for a single `embed()` call when using `EmbeddingModelType.Plugin`. Applies only to the in-process plugin path — protects against hung host-language backends (e.g. a Python callback deadlocked on the GIL, a model stuck on CUDA OOM retries, etc.). On timeout, the dispatcher returns `Plugin` instead of blocking forever. `None` disables the timeout. The default (60 seconds) is conservative for common in-process inference; increase for large batches on slow hardware. |

### SecurityLimits

Configuration for security limits across extractors.

All limits are intentionally conservative to prevent DoS attacks
while still supporting legitimate documents.

##### DocumentStructure

Top-level structured document representation.

A flat array of nodes with index-based parent/child references forming a tree.
Root-level nodes have `parent: None`. Use `body_roots()` and `furniture_roots()`
to iterate over top-level content by layer.

## Validation

Call `validate()` after construction to verify all node indices are in bounds
and parent-child relationships are bidirectionally consistent.

#### Document Structure

##### DocumentExtractor

Trait for document extractor plugins.

Implement this trait to add support for new document formats or to override
built-in extraction behavior with custom logic.

## Return Type

Extractors return `InternalDocument`, a flat intermediate representation.
The pipeline converts this into the public `ExtractionResult` via the
derivation step.

## Priority System

When multiple extractors support the same MIME type, the registry selects
the extractor with the highest priority value. Use this to:

- Override built-in extractors (priority > 50)
- Provide fallback extractors (priority < 50)
- Implement specialized extractors for specific use cases

Default priority is 50.

## Thread Safety

Extractors must be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`) to support concurrent extraction.

_Opaque type — fields are not directly accessible._

Backends that support runtime tuning (mode switching, preprocessing flags, inference parameters, etc.) read this value and deserialize the keys they care about. Keys unknown to the backend are silently ignored, so options from different backends can coexist in the same config without conflict. Example (custom backend): `json { "mode": "fast", "enable_layout": true }` |

##### OcrBackend

Trait for OCR backend plugins.

Implement this trait to add custom OCR capabilities. OCR backends can be:

- Native Rust implementations (like Tesseract)
- FFI bridges to Python libraries (like EasyOCR, PaddleOCR)
- Cloud-based OCR services (Google Vision, AWS Textract, etc.)

## Thread Safety

OCR backends must be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`) to support concurrent processing.

| `mime_type` | `String` | —       | MIME type string, e.g., "application/pdf"                 |

---

##### EmbeddingBackend

Trait for in-process embedding backend plugins.

Async to match the convention used by `OcrBackend`,
`DocumentExtractor`, and `PostProcessor`.
Host-language bridges (PyO3, napi-rs, Rustler, extendr, magnus, ext-php-rs,
C FFI, etc.) wrap their synchronous host callables in `spawn_blocking` or the
equivalent to satisfy the async signature.

## Thread safety

Backends must be `Send + Sync + 'static`. They are stored in
`Arc<dyn EmbeddingBackend>` and called concurrently from kreuzberg's chunking
pipeline. If the backend's underlying model isn't thread-safe, the backend
itself must serialize access internally (e.g. via `Mutex<Inner>`).

## Contract

- `embed(texts)` MUST return exactly `texts.len()` vectors, each of length
  `self.dimensions()`. The dispatcher in `embed_texts`
  validates this before returning to downstream consumers; a non-conforming
  backend surfaces as a `KreuzbergError.Validation`, not a panic.
- `embed` may be called from any thread. Its future must be `Send`
  (enforced by `async_trait` when `#[async_trait]` is used on non-WASM targets).
- `dimensions()` is called exactly once at registration, immediately after
  `initialize()` succeeds. The returned value is cached by the registry and
  used for all subsequent shape validation. Lazy-loading implementations can
  defer model loading into `initialize()` and report the real dimension
  afterwards. Later mutations of the backend's reported dimension are not
  observed by kreuzberg — implementations that need to change dimension
  must unregister and re-register.
- `shutdown()` (inherited from `Plugin`) may be invoked
  concurrently with an in-flight `embed()` call. Implementations must
  tolerate this — e.g. by letting in-flight calls finish using resources
  held via the `Arc<dyn EmbeddingBackend>` reference, and only releasing
  shared state that isn't needed by `embed`.

## Runtime

The synchronous `embed_texts` entry uses
`tokio.task.block_in_place` to await the trait's async `embed`, which
requires a multi-thread tokio runtime. Callers running inside a
`current_thread` runtime (e.g. `#[tokio.test]` without `flavor = "multi_thread"`,
or `tokio.runtime.Builder.new_current_thread()`) must use
`embed_texts_async` instead, which awaits directly without
`block_in_place`.

---

### PostProcessor

Trait for post-processor plugins.

Post-processors transform or enrich extraction results after the initial
extraction is complete. They can:

- Clean and normalize text
- Add metadata (language, keywords, entities)
- Split content into chunks
- Score quality
- Apply custom transformations

## Processing Order

Post-processors are executed in stage order:

1. **Early** - Language detection, entity extraction
2. **Middle** - Keyword extraction, token reduction
3. **Late** - Custom hooks, final validation

Within each stage, processors are executed in registration order.

## Error Handling

Post-processor errors are non-fatal by default - they're captured in metadata
and execution continues. To make errors fatal, return an error from `process()`.

## Thread Safety

Post-processors must be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`).

_Opaque type — fields are not directly accessible._

---

### Renderer

Trait for document renderers that convert `InternalDocument` to output strings.

Renderers are typically stateless converters that transform the internal
document representation into a specific output format (Markdown, HTML,
Djot, plain text, etc.). They participate in the standard `Plugin`
lifecycle so custom renderers can be registered from any supported binding
language.

The format name is exposed via `Plugin.name`. For stateless renderers
the `Plugin` lifecycle methods (`version`, `initialize`, `shutdown`) all
take no-op defaults and need not be overridden.

## Thread Safety

Renderers must be `Send + Sync` (inherited from `Plugin`).

_Opaque type — fields are not directly accessible._

---

### Plugin

Base trait that all plugins must implement.

This trait provides common functionality for plugin lifecycle management,
identification, and metadata.

## Thread Safety

All plugins must be `Send + Sync` to support concurrent usage across threads.

_Opaque type — fields are not directly accessible._

---

### Validator

Trait for validator plugins.

Validators check extraction results for quality, completeness, or correctness.
Unlike post-processors, validator errors **fail fast** - if a validator returns
an error, the extraction fails immediately.

## Use Cases

- **Quality Gates**: Ensure extracted content meets minimum quality standards
- **Compliance**: Verify content meets regulatory requirements
- **Content Filtering**: Reject documents containing unwanted content
- **Format Validation**: Verify extracted content structure
- **Security Checks**: Scan for malicious content

## Error Handling

Validator errors are **fatal** - they cause the extraction to fail and bubble up
to the caller. Use validators for hard requirements that must be met.

For non-fatal checks, use post-processors instead.

## Thread Safety

Validators must be thread-safe (`Send + Sync`).

_Opaque type — fields are not directly accessible._

| `has_vector_graphics` | `bool`           | —       | Whether this page contains non-trivial vector graphics (paths, shapes, curves) Indicates the presence of vector-drawn content such as charts, diagrams, or geometric shapes (e.g., from Adobe InDesign, LaTeX TikZ). These are invisible to `ExtractionResult.images` since they are not embedded as raster XObjects. Set to `true` when path count exceeds a heuristic threshold, signaling that downstream consumers may want to rasterize the page to capture this content. Only populated for PDFs; `None` for other document types. |

##### PageContent

Content for a single page/slide.

When page extraction is enabled, documents are split into per-page content
with associated tables and images mapped to each page.

## Performance

Uses Arc-wrapped tables and images for memory efficiency:

- `Vec<Arc<Table>>` enables zero-copy sharing of table data
- `Vec<Arc<ExtractedImage>>` enables zero-copy sharing of image data
- Maintains exact JSON compatibility via custom Serialize/Deserialize

This reduces memory overhead for documents with shared tables/images
by avoiding redundant copies during serialization.

##### ChunkSizing

How chunk size is measured.

Defaults to `Characters` (Unicode character count). When using token-based sizing,
chunks are sized by token count according to the specified tokenizer.

Token-based sizing uses HuggingFace tokenizers loaded at runtime. Any tokenizer
available on HuggingFace Hub can be used, including OpenAI-compatible tokenizers
(e.g., `Xenova/gpt-4o`, `Xenova/cl100k_base`).

##### ChunkerType

Type of text chunker to use.

## Variants

- `Text` - Generic text splitter, splits on whitespace and punctuation
- `Markdown` - Markdown-aware splitter, preserves formatting and structure
- `Yaml` - YAML-aware splitter, creates one chunk per top-level key
- `Semantic` - Topic-aware chunker. With an `EmbeddingConfig`, splits at
  embedding-based topic shifts tuned by `topic_threshold` (default 0.75,
  lower = more splits). Without an embedding, falls back to a
  structural-boundary heuristic (ALL-CAPS headers, numbered sections,
  blank-line paragraphs) and merges groups into chunks capped at
  `max_characters` (default 1000). `topic_threshold` has no effect in the
  fallback path. For best results, pair with an embedding model.

| Variant    | Wire value | Description     |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| `Text`     | `text`     | Text format     |

| `Llm`    | `llm`      | Provider-hosted embedding model via liter-llm.

| `Plugin` | `plugin`   | In-process embedding backend registered via the plugin system. The caller registers an `EmbeddingBackend` once (e.g. a wrapper around an already-loaded `llama-cpp-python`, `sentence-transformers`, or tuned ONNX model), then references it by name in config. Kreuzberg calls back into the registered backend during chunking and standalone embed requests — no HuggingFace download, no ONNX Runtime requirement, no HTTP sidecar. When this variant is selected, only the following `EmbeddingConfig` fields apply: `normalize` (post-call L2 normalization) and `max_embed_duration_secs` (dispatcher timeout). Model-loading fields (`batch_size`, `cache_dir`, `show_download_progress`, `acceleration`) are ignored — the host owns the model lifecycle. Semantic chunking falls back to `ChunkingConfig.max_characters` when this variant is used, since there is no preset to look a chunk-size ceiling up against — size your context window via `max_characters` directly. See `register_embedding_backend`. — Fields: `name`: `String` |

##### LayoutClass

The 17 canonical document layout classes.

All model backends (RT-DETR, YOLO, etc.) map their native class IDs
to this shared set. Models with fewer classes (DocLayNet: 11, PubLayNet: 5)
map to the closest equivalent.

Wire format is snake_case in all serializers (JSON, TOML, YAML).
