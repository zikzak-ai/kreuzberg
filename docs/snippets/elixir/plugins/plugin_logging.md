<!-- snippet:skip reason="Elixir Rustler NIFs cannot host async Send + Sync + 'static Rust trait objects via callbacks; the BEAM actor-model boundary requires plugin work to live in the Rust core.

Plugin logging is not directly available in the Elixir binding. Logging must be implemented in the Rust plugin code itself using the `tracing` crate.

To add logging to a Rust plugin:

```rust
use tracing::{debug, info, warn};

#[async_trait]
impl DocumentExtractor for MyExtractor {
    async fn extract_bytes(
        &self,
        content: &[u8],
        mime_type: &str,
        _config: &ExtractionConfig,
    ) -> Result<ExtractionResult> {
        debug!("Starting extraction for {}", mime_type);

        // Extraction logic...

        info!("Extraction completed for {}", mime_type);
        Ok(result)
    }
}
```

The logs will be captured by Kreuzberg's tracing infrastructure and can be monitored from Elixir through structured logging in the output.
