# Worker Thread Pool Example

Use worker pools for CPU-bound batch processing to maximize parallelism and throughput:

```typescript
import { createWorkerPool, extractFileInWorker, batchExtractFilesInWorker, closeWorkerPool } from '@kreuzberg/node';

// Create a pool with 4 worker threads
const pool = createWorkerPool(4);

try {
  // Extract single file in worker
  const result = await extractFileInWorker(pool, 'document.pdf', null, {
    useCache: true
  });
  console.log(result.content);

  // Extract multiple files concurrently
  const files = ['doc1.pdf', 'doc2.docx', 'doc3.xlsx'];
  const results = await batchExtractFilesInWorker(pool, files, {
    useCache: true
  });

  results.forEach((result, i) => {
    console.log(`File ${i + 1}: ${result.content.length} characters`);
  });
} finally {
  // Always close the pool when done
  await closeWorkerPool(pool);
}
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple documents extracted simultaneously
- **CPU Utilization**: Maximizes multi-core CPU usage for large batches
- **Queue Management**: Automatically distributes work across available workers
- **Resource Control**: Prevents thread exhaustion with configurable pool size

**Best Practices:**
- Use worker pools for batches of 10+ documents
- Set pool size to number of CPU cores (default behavior)
- Always close pools with `closeWorkerPool()` to prevent resource leaks
- Reuse pools across multiple batch operations for efficiency
