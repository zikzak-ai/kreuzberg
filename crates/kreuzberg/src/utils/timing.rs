//! Cross-platform timing utilities.

//! `std::time::Instant` is not available on `wasm32` targets (causes `RuntimeError: unreachable`).
//! This module provides a lightweight [`Instant`] wrapper that uses the native monotonic clock on
//! non-WASM platforms and falls back to a no-op (zero elapsed) on WASM, where the timing data is
//! only used for optional tracing diagnostics.

/// A platform-aware instant for measuring elapsed time.
///
/// On native targets this delegates to [`std::time::Instant`].
/// On `wasm32` targets it is a zero-cost no-op to avoid the `unreachable` trap.
