# Changelog

All notable changes to Kreuzberg will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- RTF extractor now builds structured tables (markdown + cells) and parses RTF `\info` metadata (authors, dates, counts), bringing parity with DOCX/ODT fixtures.
- New pandoc-generated RTF fixtures with embedded metadata for `word_sample`, `lorem_ipsum`, and `extraction_test` to validate cross-format extraction.

### Fixed
- Comprehensive lint cleanup across the crate and tests (clippy warnings resolved).
- Publish workflow now tolerates apt-managed RubyGems installations by skipping unsupported `gem update --system` during gem rebuild and installs a fallback .NET SDK when the runner lacks `dotnet`.
- Docker publish now skips pushing when the target version tag already exists, avoiding redundant builds for released images.
- Docker tag existence is checked upfront before any publish work, and per-variant publish jobs are skipped early when the version is already present.
- Added preflight checks for CLI, Go, and Rust crates to skip build/publish when the release artifacts already exist.
- Maven publishing now uses Sonatype Central’s `central-publishing-maven-plugin` with auto-publish/wait and Central user-token credentials, replacing the legacy OSSRH endpoint.
- Python wheels are now built with `manylinux: auto` parameter (was incorrectly set to `manylinux2014` which is not a valid maturin-action value), fixing PyPI upload rejection of `linux_x86_64` platform tags.
- manylinux wheel builds now detect container type (CentOS vs Debian) and set correct `OPENSSL_LIB_DIR` paths (`/usr/lib64` for CentOS, `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` for Debian) to avoid openssl-sys build failures in maturin builds.

## [4.0.0-rc.6] - 2025-12-07

result = await extract_file("document.pdf")
result = await extract_bytes(data, "application/pdf")
results = await batch_extract_files(["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf"])

# Sync variants available
result = extract_file_sync("document.pdf")
result = extract_bytes_sync(data, "application/pdf")
results = batch_extract_files_sync(["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf"])
```

**New TypeScript/Node.js API**:
```typescript
import { extractFile, extractFileSync, ExtractionConfig } from 'kreuzberg';

// Async
const result = await extractFile('document.pdf');

// Sync
const result = extractFileSync('document.pdf');

// With configuration
const config = new ExtractionConfig({ enableQualityProcessing: true });
const result = await extractFile('document.pdf', null, config);
```

**Rust API**:
```rust
use kreuzberg::{extract_file, ExtractionConfig};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> kreuzberg::Result<()> {
    let config = ExtractionConfig::default();
    let result = extract_file("document.pdf", None, &config).await?;
    println!("Extracted: {}", result.content);
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Configuration

**Strongly-Typed Configuration**:
- All configuration uses typed structs/classes (no more dictionaries)
- `ExtractionConfig`, `OcrConfig`, `ChunkingConfig`, etc.
- Compile-time validation of configuration options
- Better IDE autocomplete and type checking

**Configuration File Support**:
- TOML, YAML, and JSON configuration files
- Automatic discovery from current/parent directories
- `kreuzberg.toml`, `kreuzberg.yaml`, or `kreuzberg.json`
- CLI, API server, and MCP server all support config files

#### Result Types

**Enhanced ExtractionResult**:
```python
@dataclass
class ExtractionResult:
    content: str
    mime_type: str
    metadata: Metadata  # Strongly-typed metadata
    tables: List[ExtractedTable]
    detected_languages: Optional[List[str]]  # NEW in v4
    chunks: Optional[List[str]]
```

**Strongly-Typed Metadata**:
- `PdfMetadata`, `ExcelMetadata`, `EmailMetadata`, `ImageMetadata`, etc.
- Type-safe access to format-specific metadata
- No more dictionary casting or key errors

### Plugin System

#### PostProcessors
```python
from kreuzberg import register_post_processor, ExtractionResult

class MyPostProcessor:
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "my_processor"

    def process(self, result: ExtractionResult) -> ExtractionResult:
        # Transform result
        return result

register_post_processor(MyPostProcessor())
```

#### Validators
```python
from kreuzberg import register_validator, ExtractionResult

class MyValidator:
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "my_validator"

    def validate(self, result: ExtractionResult) -> None:
        if len(result.content) < 10:
            raise ValidationError("Content too short")

register_validator(MyValidator())
```

#### Custom OCR Backends
```python
from kreuzberg import register_ocr_backend

class CloudOCR:
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "cloud_ocr"

    def extract_text(self, image_bytes: bytes, language: str) -> str:
        # Call cloud OCR API
        return extracted_text

register_ocr_backend(CloudOCR())
```
