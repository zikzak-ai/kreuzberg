When working on kreuzberg:

1. Rust core is the single source of truth — all business logic in crates/kreuzberg/src/
2. Bindings (Python, TypeScript, Ruby, PHP, etc.) are thin wrappers — never duplicate core logic
3. Use `task` commands for all operations: `task build`, `task test`, `task lint`, `task format`
4. Build FFI layer first if needed: `cargo build --release --package kreuzberg-ffi`
5. For ONNX features: ensure ORT_LIB_LOCATION is set or use download-binaries feature
6. All unsafe blocks require SAFETY comments. No .unwrap() in production code.
7. Coverage targets: 95% for Rust core, 80% for bindings
8. WASM builds are sync-only — implement SyncExtractor for WASM-compatible extractors
9. Version in root Cargo.toml is the single source of truth for all binding packages
